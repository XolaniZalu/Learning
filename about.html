    <h1>About</h1>

    <p> 
        My professional life is nothing short of an amazement for me, I say this because I was born in an underprivileged background, meaning that I had to fight for everything I have now. I cannot remember much about my Elementary and Middle school days, It feels like they just flew by. My high school days were a different story. I still remember everything like it happened yesterday, from being subjected to bullying to a deteriorating mental health and dropping self-esteem. I never saw myself as something, mainly because I am a first generation student, and I honestly had it hard. Below, I will outline my journey to graduation.

        <dt><h3>My High School Days:</h3></dt>
          <dd>This is where everything began. I remember seeing my name on a list of learners that were placed in the Commerce stream, to be honest, I was disappointed because I wanted to do Math and Physics, but I went on to do Math and Accounting.</dd>
          <dd>I remember repeating grade 10 because of my attitude towards my studies, my priorities and my poor choice of friends. I had to repeat grade 10 in 2013. During the 2013 academic year, one of my teachers came up to me and said <!--TODO: Add a quote--> <em>I hope last year taught you something.</em> That really had me thinking, I told myself that I am changing, I am completing high school.</dd>
